React is based on the principle of components, which are divided into logic, styles and layout.

The layout is the distribution of views on the screen. Made with HTML.
The logic changes the behavior of the layout and its appearance. Made with JavaScript.
The styles changes the properties of the layout (font, size, colourâ€¦). Made with CSS.

Every webpage has its own layout with its respective logic. Moreover, there is a common logic file to the entire the website.
The styles are common to the entire the website.

A webpage is divided into this order: Page > Container > Component. A component is composed by layout, logic and style.

The atomic design (https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) divides the elements of the layout like this:
- Atoms. I.e. a button
- Molecules. I.e. a bunch of non-connected and incoherent components.
- Organisms. I.e. a bunch of connected and incoherent components.
- Templates. I.e. a bunch of connected and coherent components.
- Pages. I.e. a template with actual content.
